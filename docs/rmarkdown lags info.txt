Rstudio version 1.1.463 
issues only in rmarkdown with lags when typing, moving scroll bar
fix is to right click on application -> properties -> Compatibility tab -> change high DPI settings
-> override high dpi scaling behavior -> scaling performed by system (enhanced) 
Then restart Rstudio
This will make the graphs extra large so you won't be able to see the whole graph.
I could turn this option off to see what the graphs are like, and then when I know the graphs are good, turn it back on.
Works as a short-term fix until I can get a more recent version of Rstudio which has a permanent fix.
